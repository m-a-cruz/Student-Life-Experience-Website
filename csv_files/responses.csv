BS Computer Science,4th year,"Regular student, Scholar",Dissatisfied,"Academic courses, Extracurricular activities, Faculty interaction",Financial issues,Significantly improved,Very supported,"Instructors should avoid getting a lot of panel members and panel members who are not even knowledgeable about the topic. I think that 3–4 panel members are already enough; you don't even need 7–10 people per presentation. It is also an additional burden for students because they provide food and drinks for them. Additionally, instructors should avoid getting panel members who have zero or minimal knowledge of the subject; they end up giving low grades to the students just because they couldn't grasp the concepts and requirements of the subject.",4,5,"The college should implement blended learning again, considering the high heat index, which is risky for both students and instructors.

In this case, it causes a lot of inconvenience, especially when it's an announcement about no classes. 2.) In addition to point #1, the instructors should be more considerate of the students situations. We are fully aware of the high heat index.

Thus we hope to have more student safe spaces. Also, the services offered from the cashier, accounting and registrar during the enrollment process is very impractical when a transaction can be done in just a day but takes us a long time— because of the reason that the school is overcrowded, yet they lack in manpower. Lastly, the AIMS portal which frequently have errors, and some informations are not updated. For example, our grades which is supposed to be labeled as PASSED but is labeled as FAILED. The error in ledgers, the unupdated grades because some professors did not typed in the grades, and lastly, the need to insert birthdate to login when the student have already inputted their id number and password.
